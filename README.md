# HERE_COMES_THE_CUSTOMER
## Project Description:
A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

 ## A/B Test:
 An A/B test consists of a control version (like the current 5 days a week delivery service) and a treatment version (like the proposed 3 days a week delivery service). Based on the previous clusters, the A/B test needs to be performed in a manner such that some portion of customers from both segments (both retail and restaurant) experience the control as well the treatment.
So, the delivery service should be changed for some customers from cluster 0 as well as for some customers from cluster 1. This will allow the wholesale distributor to determine which cluster's customers would react positively to the change in delivery service and which cluster's customers would react negatively to the same change.
